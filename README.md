# blogREST_API
This is a REST API with all the basic operations I created to manage my blog.
You need to import the database 'rest_db.sql'
I used Postman to handle my API request.
You can get the database within the database folder.

It supports all the basic operations like POST, GET, PUT, DELETE.

Feel free to clone it and use it.
